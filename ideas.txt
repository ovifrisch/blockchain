In the current version of OviCoin, you can add transactions to the chain
and you can mine a block. However, whenever you decide to mine, you have
to wait until the mining is completed until you can add any other transactions.

This of course is unacceptable. I have the idea that I can solev this problem by
using a separate thread to mine, but it seems like this would introduce a whole lot of race conditions
because of the shared state that these threads would be modifying: the
"pending transactions" array. Actually, what if you just create a single critical section
in which you make a copy of the pending arrays and then reset the pending arrays to 0.
Then there would be no shared state problems.





For example, consider this:

These are the pending transactions:

[t1, t2, t3]
